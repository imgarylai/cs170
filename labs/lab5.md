# Lab 5

## Goals:

- Learn to write for-loops to make text based drawings.

Please, make sure that you have added the honor code statement at the top of your Java file:

```java
/*
  THIS CODE IS MY OWN WORK, IT WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT CONSULTING       
  CODE WRITTEN BY OTHER STUDENTS. _Your_Name_Here_
*/
```

## Preparation: Create your ~/cs170/lab5/, and copy files

```
mkdir ~/cs170/lab5
cp  ~cs170001/share/lab5/*  ~/cs170/lab5
cd ~/cs170/lab5
```
