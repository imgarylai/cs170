# cs170
CS170 at Emory University

This is the repo that helps me organize content for being TA for cs170. 

Contents here are from Prof. Shun Y. Cheung's page: http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/170/labs/index.html. 

If you find any errors, please leave message in the [issue page](https://github.com/imgarylai/cs170/issues). I would fix it as soon as possible. 

## Goal of the lab exercises

What the labs are not intended for:

- Lab exercises are not intended to test your knowledge in any material
- So if you ask for an answer, the TA will give it to you.
- In other words: there is no excuse for you to do poorly in these lab exercises.

What is the labs intended for:
- Working with computers are best learned by example (show me how to do it)
- The lab exercises put you in new situations where you can learn new skills with the help of TA's

What students should do to get the maximum benefit from the lab exercises:
- Read the related materials (see each lab assignment) before coming to the lab.
- Do the lab assignment as independently as possible.
- When you cannot figure out a problem, ask the TA's for help.
> Remember the solution shown by the TA (this is "hands on" learning)
